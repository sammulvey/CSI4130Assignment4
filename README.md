# CSI4130Assignment4

CSI4130Assignment4

This is the final assignment for the 4130[A] Computer Graphics Course at the University of Ottawa.

The theme of this project is "Winter Wonderland." As such, we created a snowy landscape, with Santa flying through the middle in a harmonographic fashion.

Each model has its license in their respective folders to pay tribute to where we obtained them from.

Additionally, we have created a presentation video to walk through the key aspects of the project.
